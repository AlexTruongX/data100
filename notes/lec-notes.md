## Lecture 1 - Course Overview

### What is Data Science?
**Data Science** is the application of data centric, computational, and inferential thinking to:

### Primary Goal in this course
Be able to take data and produce useful insights on the world's most challenging and ambiguous problems.

### Topics covered:
![Topics Covered in data 100](../images/IMG_0978.png)

### The Data Science Life Cycle:
1. Question/Problem Formulation:
   * What do we want to know?
   * What problems are we trying to solve?
   * What are the hypotheses we want to test?
   * What are our metrics for success? 

2. Data Acquisition and Cleaning
   * What data do we have and what data do we need?
   * How will we sample more data?
   * Is our data representative of the population we want to study?

3. Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualizations
   * How is our data organized and what does it contain?
   * Do we already have relevant data?
   * What are the biases, anomalies, or other issues with the data?
   * How do we transform the data to enable effective analysis?

4. Prediction and Inference
   * What does the data say about the world?
   * Does it answer our questions or accurately solve the problem?
   * How robust are our conclusions and can we trust the predictions?
